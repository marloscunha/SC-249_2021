 The first LAB was to get used with Simulink's UAV Toolbox and its features.
 In order to achieve this goal, MathWork's "UAV Package Delivery" Tutorial was given as an activity. The whole tutorial should be run and its modules, models and working explained.
 
 This repository intends not to cover the explanations, but rather to provide changes to the standard code in order to allow a better and deeper comprehension of the simulation enviroment - the tutorial was seen as a first step which would need tweakings to provide better comprehension.
